RHUD is a free project aimed to make the heads up display design of servers better (or easier to change if worse).

Any hud located in lua/rhud/huds/ will be mounted and ready 
to use if the correct gamemode is playing or the hud is useable across all gamemodes.

If I put a hud (for example "simple") in lua/rhud/huds/sandbox/simple/, 
it needs to be called core.lua - or it won't get mounted. This way you can
have tidier huds if you choose to replace weapon wheels or scoreboards. 

Most elements of the hud are replaceable. If the hud has the function .ShowScoreboard, 
the default scoreboard will not show and yours will. Huds can add elements to the table 
HideElements in the hud table to hide anything, instead of using the HUDShouldDraw hook.
(A list can be found http://maurits.tv/data/garrysmod/wiki/wiki.garrysmod.com/index5865.html here)

For developers, some helper functions can be utilised. You can find them in "writing a hud.txt" or rhud/helper.lua, 
if it's not obvious what they do you can look at the default huds included with rhud to get a better idea.

The players avatar is also supplied to the hud in the form of (hud table).Avatar, as well as a 
dmodelpanel of the playermodel (.PlayerModel). 
These are both parented to the hud, however they will not be visible unless 
(hud table).UsesAvatar and (hud table).UsesPlayerModel are set to boolean true.
The LocalPlayer is also supplied in the form of (hud table).Player

Configuration options can be set and autoread by doing 
(hud table).Config["Config Name"] = { value = [true/false], info = "Information to show" }.
Config options are saved in the local sqlite database, and can be accessed in the hud by 
doing self:GetConfig( "config name" )

The hook "RHUDSuppressChoice" can be used to hide huds from the selection menu. The arguments are the name and the
hud itself, return true to suppress

If you have any more questions ask or read through existing huds.
You can sell any huds you make.

PS: Make sure you use a unique name for your hud, or it will clash.
