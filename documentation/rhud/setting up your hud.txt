Writing a hud is supposed to be as easy as possible
Create an addon, call it whatever you want.
Set up the folders like this -- lua/rhud/huds/gamemode/hud.lua
Then you can write your hud, and it will be loaded!

if you want to take advantage of a feature which allows for neater 
file structure if you have a massive hud (maybe you're rewriting the scoreboard, too), 
you can set up the folders like this -- lua/rhud/huds/gamemode/yourhudname/
the only file that will be executed is core.lua, so make sure your file is named that.
if you have set it up like so, you can call HUD:Include( name, file ) 
this will include the file for the hud, and set whatever you specified as "name" to be a pointer to the hud
so if my hud table is called HUD, I can do HUD:Include( "HUD", "scoreboard.lua" )
then in scoreboard.lua, I can call print( HUD.Name )
This way you can reskin as much as you want, without having a lot of clutter.

for the actual Lua documentation, open "writing a hud.txt"
