When writing a hud, there are a few things you can use to help.
Firstly, you can look at the example hud.lua file included to get an idea of the basic structure.
Keep in mind the only functions you actually need are HUD:Init() and HUD:Draw(), the rest are optional.

You need to set HUD.UsesAvatar/HUD.UsesPlayerModel to true to show the specified element!!

In your hud, you have access to
	HUD:GetConfigBool( "configname" )
	HUD.HideElements = { ["Something I want to hide"] = false }
	HUD.Config["NewConfigOption"] = { enabled = true, info = "hello" }

Some RHUD helper functions:
	[RHUD:CreateFont( 
		string name, 
		string font, 
		number size, 
		table extra (extra will be added to the table used in the surface.CreateFont call )
	)]
	[RHUD:DrawImageLabel(
		number x, 
		number y, 
		IMaterial img, 
		string font, 
		string text, 
		Color color, 
		Color imgcol -- optional
	)]
	[RHUD:GetHealthPercentage( Player, Maxiumum HP (defaults to 100) )]
	[RHUD:GetArmorPercentage( Player, Maxiumum Armor (defaults to 100) )]
	
	[RHUD:PaintAvatar() -- Paints the avatar to the screen]
	[RHUD:PaintModel() -- Paints the playermodel to the screen]
	
	[RHUD:GetDarkRPVars() -- returns the table of darkrp vars]
	
	[RHUD:Include( id, file ) -- includes a file if your hud is in it's own folder]
	
If your hud has a function called ShowScoreboard, the scoreboard will be hidden.
If you are writing a hud for TTT, a number of TTT hud elements can be overridden, please see cl_hud.lua
Also keep in mind that the TTT hud is detected and overridden from the client's copy of the game - so no
changes to cl_hud.lua HUDPaint will have affect
