RIM has a very simple syntax.

	$ 
		used for adding config options to the hud
		$Config1 = true/false, information about the config option
		
	>> 
		used to denote important details about the hud, like name, author, and gamemode
		>>Name = super cool hud
		
	var
		used to create static variables
		var x = y
		
		globals are fine for things that change ( x = y )
	
	FunctionName ->
		creates a function, variables are added like so
		FunctionName [ variable1, variable2 ] ->
		you do not need to add ends, whitespace is parsed. if you REALLY want to, <> or end is used.
		
the following colors can be used as globals (just write the color name)
		white = Color( 255, 255, 255 )
		black = Color( 0, 0, 0 )
		red = Color( 255, 0, 0 )
		green = Color( 0, 255, 0 )
		blue = Color( 0, 0, 255 )
