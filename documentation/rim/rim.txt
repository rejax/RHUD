RIM is an acronym for something that I can't remember. It was dumb.
It is a simple way of writing a hud that you can use across any server, as long as rhud is installed on the server.
This way, even if all custom huds look awful to you, you can still use your own.
The syntax is as simple as possible, it's supposed to be fairly easy to learn. Essentially it's the lobotomized little brother of Lua.

There is some basic symbols for RHUD support, and a looser syntax generally.
See "example rim hud.txt", and "rim_syntax.txt" for documentation.
