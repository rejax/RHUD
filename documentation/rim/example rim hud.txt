-- variables can be declared like this
var variable = 20

-- some convinience functions are supplied, see the included rim_functions.txt for a list
CreateFont( "rim_1_test", "Coolvetica", 20 )

-- functions are declared like this, like doing function HUD:Init()
Init ->
	SetAvatarPos( 30, ScrH - 95 )
	SetAvatarSize( 64, 64 )
-- you don't need to add an end, whitespace is parsed automatically and functions are closed

Draw ->
	DrawBox( 25, ScrH - 100, 260, 75, Color( 50, 50, 50 ) )
	DrawText( "Money = $*rp_money", "rim_1", 100, ScrH - 95, white )
	DrawText( "*rp_name", "rim_1", 100, ScrH - 75, white )
	DrawText( "My job is a *rp_job*, it's ok", "rim_1", 100, ScrH - 55, white )
	Draw_Avatar( "string text" )
	
-- this is how you add variables to a function.
Draw_Avatar [ variable ] ->
	  DrawAvatar()
	  echo variable
